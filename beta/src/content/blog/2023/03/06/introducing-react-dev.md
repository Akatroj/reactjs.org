<Intro>

Today, we are thrilled to announce [react.dev](https://react.dev), the new home for React and its documentation.
We rewrote the docs from scratch to teach modern React with Hooks. We've also added many interactive examples and challenges. This post will give you a tour of what's new on the site.

## tl;dr {/*tldr*/}

* The new React docs are at [react.dev](https://react.dev). The old [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org) domain now redirects to it.
* The old docs are archived at [legacy.reactjs.org](https://legacy.reactjs.org) and won't be updated.
* We've refreshed the homepage to reflect how far React has come.
* We rewrote the entire React docs to teach Hooks first.
* The new documentation has over 600 interactive examples.


## New homepage {/*new-homepage*/}

React will soon be ten years old! In JavaScript years, it is like a century.

When React came out in 2013, things were pretty different. You could try React on a page, but there was no proven way to build entire apps with it. Creating native apps with React sounded like fiction. There was no great way to reuse logic between components. And there was no React ecosystem or React community.

To celebrate how far React has come, we've refreshed the React homepage.
