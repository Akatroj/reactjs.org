title: Start a New React Project

<Intro>

If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend to pick one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community. Frameworks provide features that most apps and sites eventually need, including routing, data fetching, and generating HTML.

## Ready for production {/*ready-for-production*/}

### Next.js {/*nextjs*/}

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the most popular React framework. It lets you create React apps of any size--from a personal blog website to a complex dynamic application. Check out [Next.js Fundamentals](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) for an introductory tutorial.

By default, Next.js apps require a JavaScript server. If you you don't use any server-only features, you can enable [Static HTML Export](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export) to get a completely static version of your app as a bundle of HTML, JS, and CSS.

Next.js is developed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
